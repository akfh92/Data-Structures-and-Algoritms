Given two non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one.

def isValidSubsequence(array, sequence):
    # Write your code here.
# 	first create two index which acts as a pointer for array and the sequence.
    arrIndex = 0
	seqIndex = 0 
# 	while loop to compare in each iteration and if matched then increment the sequence index. 
	while arrIndex < len(array) and seqIndex < len(sequence):
		if array[arrIndex] == sequence[seqIndex]:
			seqIndex += 1
			
		arrIndex += 1
# 	if the sequence index matches the length of the sequence then the function will return true else false.
	return seqIndex == len(sequence)
